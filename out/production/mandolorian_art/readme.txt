Yes or no? 

Yes, Ardak explained the syntax of how to call a function recursively 3 times.

Yes or no? 

Well, I am still working on understanding recursion. It's a bit confusing. Not the concept of recursion but the part with x's and y's.

I spent a day or two trying to understand HTree.java and another day or two writing Sierpinski.java. I was done on Sunday. On Monday, Arman explained everything in an hour. I was a bit frustrated because writing the Sierpinski would have taken me much less time if we were shown this lecture BEFORE we started working on the 4th project. It would have saved me so much time... :/

Art. Java
I loved the assignment. Was a bit difficult working without instructions but I had fun. My Art.java prints a made-up scene from Mandalorian with two recursive functions. It is on Tatooine, a fractal tree which branches change color when the length gets short, is on the left. There are Din Djarin's and baby Gorge's silhouettes in the middle. Moff Gideon's 546 Cruiser and many TIE fighters, that appear recursively upwards, are in the sky ready to attack Mando in order to take Grogu from him.
