# Mandalorian Art Project

## Overview

This Java project creates a visual scene inspired by The Mandalorian, featuring a fractal tree, silhouettes of Din Djarin and Baby Yoda (Grogu), and iconic elements like Moff Gideon's Cruiser and TIE fighters.

## Art.java

The `Art.java` file contains the main code for rendering the Mandalorian-themed scene. It utilizes recursion to draw the fractal tree and positions various elements to create the desired visual composition.

### How to Run

1. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc.).
2. Run the `Art.java` file.

## Adding stdlib.jar

This project relies on the `stdlib.jar` library, which contains utility classes used in the code. Follow the steps below to include `stdlib.jar` in your project:

1. Download `stdlib.jar` from [this link](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/).
2. Create a folder named `lib` in your project directory.
3. Copy the downloaded `stdlib.jar` file into the `lib` folder.
4. In your Java IDE, right-click on the `stdlib.jar` file in the `lib` folder and choose "Add as Library" or a similar option to include it in your project's classpath.

### How to Set Up Dependencies in IntelliJ IDEA

If you are using IntelliJ IDEA, you can follow these specific steps:

1. Open your Java project in IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Click on "File" -> "Project Structure."
3. Navigate to "Modules" -> "Dependencies."
4. Click on the "+" sign and choose "JARs or directories."
5. Select the `stdlib.jar` file from the "lib" folder in your project.
6. Click "OK" to apply the changes.

## Fractal Tree

The fractal tree on the left side of the scene is created using a recursive algorithm. The color of the branches changes as the length decreases, adding visual interest to the tree.
